# Flare Network — General Knowledge

## What Flare Is

**Flare** is an interoperable, EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain engineered for data-rich, interconnected applications. Its key differentiator is **enshrined data protocols** built directly into the core protocol, meaning all validators participate in data provision, and the entire network's economic security backs every data feed.

**Core value propositions:**
- **Enshrined oracles** — FTSO and FDC are protocol-level, not third-party add-ons.
- **Fast finality** — ~1.8 second block time with single-slot finality (Snowman++ consensus).
- **EVM-compatible** — Deploy any Solidity/Vyper contract; supports Cancun hard fork opcodes.
- **Interoperable** — Native bridges to XRP Ledger, Bitcoin, Dogecoin via FAssets; cross-chain data via FDC.

## Core Protocols

| Protocol | What It Does |
|----------|-------------|
| **FTSO** (Flare Time Series Oracle) | Decentralized block-latency price feeds (~1.8s), ~100 data providers, stake-weighted selection. Also provides Scaling anchor feeds every 90s. |
| **FDC** (Flare Data Connector) | Validates external data (cross-chain transactions, Web2 APIs) via attestation consensus and Merkle proofs. |
| **FAssets** | Trustless wrapped tokens (FXRP, FBTC, FDOGE) enabling XRP, BTC, and DOGE holders to use Flare DeFi. |
| **Smart Accounts** | Account abstraction letting XRPL users interact with Flare without holding FLR. |

Validators on Flare serve a dual role: they participate in consensus **and** act as data providers for FTSO and FDC.

## Networks

| Network | Role | Native Token | Chain ID |
|---------|------|--------------|----------|
| **Flare Mainnet** | Production | FLR (18 decimals) | 14 |
| **Coston2** | dApp testnet | C2FLR (18 decimals) | 114 |
| **Songbird** | Canary / protocol experiments | SGB (18 decimals) | 19 |
| **Coston** | Protocol testnet | CFLR (18 decimals) | 16 |

**Development path:**
- **dApp development:** Coston2 → Flare Mainnet

## Key npm Packages

| Package | Use |
|---------|-----|
| [`@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts) | Solidity interfaces for Hardhat/Foundry (network-specific: `coston2/`, `flare/`, `songbird/`) |
| [`@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contract-artifacts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contract-artifacts) | ABI artifacts for offchain scripts (`interfaceToAbi()`) |
| [`@flarenetwork/flare-wagmi-periphery-package`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-wagmi-periphery-package) | Wagmi/viem typed contract interactions for Flare periphery contracts |

## Contract Resolution

Flare uses a **ContractRegistry** pattern — never hardcode contract addresses. Always resolve them at runtime:

```solidity
import {ContractRegistry} from "@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts/coston2/ContractRegistry.sol";

// Examples
IFtsoV2 ftso = ContractRegistry.getFtsoV2();
IFdcHub fdcHub = ContractRegistry.getFdcHub();
```

The `ContractRegistry` address itself is stable per network. Use network-specific imports (`coston2/`, `flare/`, `songbird/`, `coston/`).

## Developer Quickstart

### Using Hardhat

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-hardhat-starter
cd flare-hardhat-starter
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # add your private key and API keys
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/your-script.ts --network coston2
```

### Using Foundry

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-foundry-starter
cd flare-foundry-starter
forge install
forge build
forge script script/YourScript.s.sol --rpc-url https://coston2-api.flare.network/ext/C/rpc
```

### Hardhat Config (network setup)

```js
networks: {
  coston2: {
    url: "https://coston2-api.flare.network/ext/C/rpc",
    chainId: 114,
    accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
  },
  flare: {
    url: "https://flare-api.flare.network/ext/C/rpc",
    chainId: 14,
    accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
  },
}
```

**Important:** Always set `evmVersion: "cancun"` in your Solidity compiler settings when using Flare periphery contracts.

## Flare Systems Protocol (FSP)

The **Flare Systems Protocol (FSP)** is the foundational infrastructure that powers Flare's enshrined protocols (FTSO, FDC). It provides decentralized consensus via weighted voting by **data providers** (also called voters), who gain vote power through community delegations of WFLR or P-chain stake.

### Vote Power

Vote power comes from two sources:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **P-chain Stake (WP)** | FLR staked by validators or delegated to them on the P-chain |
| **WNat Delegations (WWFLR)** | Wrapped FLR (WFLR) delegated via the WNat contract |

Derived weight types:
- **Mirrored Stake (WM)** — P-chain state mirrored to C-chain smart contracts
- **Capped Delegation Weight (W'WFLR)** — WFLR delegation capped at 2.5% of total WFLR weight
- **Registration Weight** — `(W'WFLR + WM)^0.75`
- **Signing Weight (WS)** — normalized registration weight, compressed to 2-byte values per provider

### Timing

| Period | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| **Voting epoch** | 90 seconds |
| **Reward epoch** | 3,360 voting epochs (~3.5 days) |

### System Protocols

FSP comprises four core protocols:

| Protocol | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Signing Policy Definition** | ~2 hrs before reward epoch end | Locks data providers and weights for the next epoch |
| **Validator Uptime Voting** | After each reward epoch | Providers vote on which validators achieved ≥80% uptime |
| **Reward Voting** | After uptime voting | Providers aggregate reward claims into a Merkle tree; `RewardManager` executes payouts |
| **Random Number Generation** | Each voting epoch | Derived from FTSOv2 commit-reveal; stored in `Relay` contract |

**Consensus threshold:** >50% signing weight required. Rises to 60%+ if delayed.

### Rewarding

Rewards are distributed per reward epoch by the `RewardManager` contract. Providers start with 0 passes (max 3) and gain/lose passes based on minimum participation:

| Protocol | Minimum Participation |
|----------|-----------------------|
| Staking | ≥80% validator uptime + ≥1M FLR active self-bond |
| FTSO anchor feeds | Estimates within 0.5% of consensus median in ≥80% of rounds |
| FTSO block-latency feeds | Submit ≥80% of expected updates (waived if weight <0.2%) |
| FDC | Participate in ≥60% of voting rounds |

**Reward claim types:** Direct, Fee (provider delegation/staking fees), WFLR (delegator rewards), Mirror (stake delegator rewards).

## Flare TX SDK

The **`@flarenetwork/flare-tx-sdk`** is the official Node.js toolkit for performing common actions on all Flare networks.

**Supported operations:** claim rewards (FlareDrops, staking, FTSO delegation, rFLR), delegate to FTSO providers, stake on P-chain, vote on governance proposals, transfer native/wrapped tokens, interact with C-chain contracts.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @flarenetwork/flare-tx-sdk
```

### Core Concepts

- **`Network`** — represents the chain (`Network.FLARE`, `Network.COSTON2`, `Network.SONGBIRD`, `Network.COSTON`). Provides query and transaction methods using Flare's public RPCs.
- **`Wallet`** — represents a user account without storing private keys. Compatible with MetaMask (EIP-1193), Ledger, Trezor, or custom signers.
- **`Amount`** — unit conversion helper: `Amount.nats(10)` = 10 FLR in wei, `Amount.wnats(10)` = 10 WFLR in wei.

### Quick Start (MetaMask)

```javascript
import { Network, EIP1193WalletController } from "@flarenetwork/flare-tx-sdk";

const network = Network.FLARE;
await window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
const controller = new EIP1193WalletController(window.ethereum);
const wallet = await controller.getActiveWallet();
const publicKey = await wallet.getPublicKey();
const balance = await network.getBalance(publicKey);
// { availableOnC, wrappedOnC, availableOnP, stakedOnP } — all in wei
```

### Common Operations

```javascript
// Balances
await network.getBalance(publicKey);
await network.getBalanceOnC(cAddress);
await network.getBalanceWrappedOnC(cAddress);
await network.getBalanceOnP(publicKey);

// Wrap / transfer
await network.transferNative(wallet, recipient, Amount.nats(1));
await network.wrapNative(wallet, Amount.nats(1));
await network.transferWrapped(wallet, recipient, Amount.wnats(1));
await network.unwrapToNative(wallet, Amount.wnats(1));

// Claim rewards
await network.claimFlareDropReward(wallet);
await network.claimStakingReward(wallet);
await network.claimFtsoReward(wallet);
await network.claimRNatReward(wallet, [projectId1, projectId2]);

// FTSO delegation
await network.delegateToFtso(wallet, providerAddress, Amount.percentages(100));
await network.undelegateFromFtso(wallet);

// P-chain staking
await network.transferToP(wallet, Amount.nats(100));
await network.delegateOnP(wallet, Amount.nats(50), nodeId, startTime, endTime);
await network.transferToC(wallet);  // move back to C-chain

// Governance
await network.castVoteForFoundationProposal(wallet, proposalId, FoundationProposalSupport.FOR);
await network.delegateGovernanceVotePower(wallet, delegateAddress);

// C-chain contract calls
await network.invokeContractCallOnC(contractAddress, abi, "methodName", [params]);
await network.invokeContractMethodOnC(wallet, contractAddress, abi, "methodName", value, [params]);
```

### Wallet Integrations

| Wallet | Package |
|--------|---------|
| MetaMask / WalletConnect (EIP-1193) | Built-in (`EIP1193WalletController`) |
| Ledger (Zondax Flare App) | `@zondax/ledger-flare` |
| Ledger (ETH App) | `@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth` |
| Trezor | `@trezor/connect` |

Private keys never leave the hardware device or wallet extension.

## Wrapped Native Tokens (WNat)

Each Flare network has a native gas token (FLR, SGB, C2FLR, CFLR). `WNat` wraps native tokens into a standard ERC-20 token required for FTSO delegation and governance voting.

**WNat is required for:**
- **FTSO delegation** — delegating vote power to data providers to earn staking rewards
- **Governance voting** — participating in FIPs, STPs, and SIPs
- **DeFi** — any protocol expecting an ERC-20 token

| Operation | Method | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Wrap | `deposit()` | `payable` — send native tokens as `msg.value` |
| Wrap to address | `depositTo(recipient)` | Wraps on behalf of another address |
| Unwrap | `withdraw(amount)` | Burns WNat, returns native tokens 1:1 |
| Unwrap to address | `withdrawTo(recipient, amount)` | Unwraps to a specific address |

Resolve the WNat contract via `ContractRegistry.getWNat()`. Full guide with Solidity and TypeScript examples: [wnat-guide.md](wnat-guide.md)

## Consensus

Flare uses **Snowman++**, a Byzantine fault-tolerant probabilistic consensus protocol from the Snow family (originally introduced by Avalanche).

### Protocol Layers

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Slush** | Nodes sample peers and update preferences via majority voting (parameters: K = sample size, Alpha = vote threshold) |
| **Snowball** | Adds confidence counters tracking consecutive successful polls to improve finalization |
| **Snowman** | Linear blockchain ordering using Kahn's topological algorithm; runs multiple Snowball instances per block height |
| **Snowman++** | Adds stake-weighted proposer selection with time-based eligibility delays per validator |

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `maxWindows` | 6 | Validators selected per block height |
| `WindowDuration` | 5 seconds | Delay between proposer eligibility windows |
| `Beta` | — | Consecutive successful queries required for finalization |

### Validator Selection

Validators are chosen via **weighted sampling without replacement** based on stake. Selection is deterministic, using the validator set and chain height as inputs.

### Properties

- **Finality:** Single-slot finality — blocks are final once confidence reaches the Beta threshold.
- **Block time:** ~1.8 seconds.
- **Fault tolerance:** Byzantine fault-tolerant.
- **Chains:** Runs on both P-chain and C-chain in Flare networks.
- **Validator dual role:** Validators also serve as data providers for FTSO and FDC.

## Governance

Flare uses on-chain governance for protocol changes. There are three proposal types across two networks.

### Proposal Types

| Type | Network | Voting Token | Mechanism |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **FIP** (Flare Improvement Proposal) | Flare Mainnet | `WFLR` + staked FLR | Acceptance-based: >50% approval, no quorum required |
| **STP** (Songbird Test Proposal) | Songbird | `WSGB` | Rejection-based: requires 75% quorum AND >50% against to reject |
| **SIP** (Songbird Improvement Proposal) | Songbird | `WSGB` | Acceptance-based: >50% approval, no quorum required |

STPs are used to test changes on Songbird before proposing them as FIPs on Flare Mainnet.

### Voting

- **Eligibility:** Token holders at the snapshot block ("Vote Count Block"), selected randomly after proposal announcement.
- **Vote power:** Proportional to token holdings at snapshot time.
- **Delegation:** Voting power can be delegated to another address without transferring token ownership. Delegation is permanent until explicitly canceled.

### Proposal Lifecycle

1. Announcement + community discussion period
2. Random Vote Count Block selection window
3. Voting period (typically one week)
4. Execution — automatic via smart contracts or manual by the Flare Foundation

### Management Group

Introduced in FIP.02/STP.03 — a governance body of FTSO data providers that votes on:
- Punitive actions against malicious providers
- New data feed additions
- New attestation types for FDC
- Protocol parameter adjustments
