/**
 * Send XRP payment for FAssets minting — Skill resource script
 *
 * Flow: Connect to XRPL testnet → build Payment with memo → sign and submit
 * Write: sends a real XRP Ledger transaction; requires a funded XRPL wallet.
 *
 * Sends XRP to an FAssets agent's underlying address with the payment reference
 * from the collateral reservation step encoded in the memo field.
 *
 * Review this script before running; execute in an isolated environment.
 * Update the constants (AGENT_ADDRESS, AMOUNT_XRP, PAYMENT_REFERENCE, wallet seed)
 * with values from your collateral reservation.
 *
 * Prerequisites: npm install xrpl
 * For proper ABI usage and type safety in related FAssets scripts, use the Flare periphery packages:
 *   - Solidity contracts: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts
 *   - Artifacts: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contract-artifacts
 *   - Wagmi types: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-wagmi-periphery-package
 * Usage: npx ts-node scripts/xrp-payment.ts
 *
 * See: https://dev.flare.network/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-mint
